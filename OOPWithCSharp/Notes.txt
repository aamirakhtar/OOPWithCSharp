OOP:-
Object oriented programming/paradiagm, its abot objects and their relationships.

Class: Recepie to make objects.
It contains only properties and methods.

properties: nouns.
functions/methods: verbs.

Object: Is a physical existance of class.

We have some types of relations or Pillars of OOP:-

1-Inheritance: Implicit Posession of properties and methods in child class from parent class. "is a" relation.
	a-Single: one parent one child
	b-Multilevel: Several children of a parent.
	c-Multipath: Several paths of children of a parent. Tree structure.
	d-Multiple: When you have one or more parents of a child. Its not implimentable in programming languages except C++.

2-Encapsulation: Accessibility of the properties and mathods.
To impliment this we use access modifiers:-
a-public: Accessible to every object.
b-private: Cannot be accessed by any object.
c-protected: Only be accessed within heirarchy or family.
d-internal: Can only be accessed within the DLL or Project.
e-protected-internal: 

3-Containment: "has a relation":
	a-Aggregation.
	b-composition.

4-Polymorphism. (Specialization)
5-Abstraction. (Generalization)
